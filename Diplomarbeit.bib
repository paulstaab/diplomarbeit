As a result of compensatory evolution, the initial fitness costs conferred by resistance mutations (or other deleterious mutations) can often be rapidly and efficiently reduced. Such compensatory evolution is potentially of importance for (i) the long-term persistence of drug resistance, (ii) reducing the rate of fitness loss associated with the accumulation of deleterious mutations in small asexual populations, and (iii) the evolution of complexity of cellular processes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Using a previously undescribed approach, we develop an analytic model that predicts whether an asexual population accumulates advantageous or deleterious mutations over time and the rate at which either process occurs. The model considers a large number of linked identical loci, or nucleotide sites; assumes that the selection coefficient per site is much less than the mutation rate per genome; and includes back and compensating mutations. Using analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the accuracy of our results over almost the entire range of population sizes. Two limiting cases of our results, when either deleterious or advantageous mutations can be neglected, correspond to the {Fisher–Muller} effect and Muller's ratchet, respectively. By comparing predictions of our model (no recombination) to those of simple single-locus models (strong recombination), we show that the accumulation of advantageous mutations is slowed by linkage over a broad, finite range of population size. This supports the view of Fisher and Muller, who argued in the 1930s that progressive evolution of organisms is slowed because loci at which beneficial mutations can occur are often linked together on the same chromosome. These results follow from our main finding, that distribution of sequences over the mutation number evolves as a traveling wave whose speed and width depend on population size and other parameters. The model explains a logarithmic dependence of steady-state fitness on the population size reported recently for an {RNA} virus.},

Despite years of intensive research, we still lack a comprehensive explanation for this {complexity.RESULTS:We} inspected the available literature and genome databases for information on components of {RNA} metabolism in land plant chloroplasts. In particular, new inventions of chloroplast-specific mechanisms and the expansion of some gene/protein families detected in land plants lead us to suggest that the primary function of the additional nuclear-encoded components found in chloroplasts is the transgenomic suppression of point mutations, fixation of which occurred due to an enhanced genetic drift exhibited by chloroplast genomes. We further speculate that a fast evolution of transgenomic suppressors occurred after the water-to-land transition of {plants.CONCLUSION:Our} inspections indicate that several chloroplast-specific mechanisms evolved in land plants to remedy point mutations that occurred after the water-to-land transition.

Although the existence of such a diffusion has been proved by Overbeck et al. (1995) using Dirichlet forms, we can now characterize the process via the martingale problem. This leads to a limit theorem justifying the diffusion approximation, using a stronger than usual topology on the state space. Also established are existence, uniqueness, and reversibility of the stationary distribution of the {Fleming-Viot} process.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.03.014},
	abstract = {This work presents a new approach to Muller's ratchet, where Haigh's model is approximately mapped into a simpler model that describes the behaviour of a population after a click of the ratchet, i.e., after loss of what was the fittest class. This new model predicts the distribution of times to the next click of the ratchet and is equivalent to a {Wright-Fisher} model for a population of haploid asexual individuals with one locus and two alleles. Within this model, the fittest members of a population correspond to carriers of one allele, while all other individuals have suboptimal fitness and are represented as carriers of the other allele. In this way, all suboptimal fitness individuals are amalgamated into a single "mutant" class.
The approach presented here has some limitations and the potential for improvement. However, it does lead to results for the rate of the ratchet that, over a wide range of parameters, are accurate within one order of magnitude of simulation results. This contrasts with existing approaches, which are designed for only one or other of the two different parameter regimes known for the ratchet and are more accurate only in the parameter regime they were designed for.
Numerical results are presented for the mean time between clicks of the ratchet for (i) the {Wright-Fisher} model, (ii) a diffusion approximation of this model and (iii) individually based simulations of a full model. The diffusion approximation is validated over a wide range of parameters by its close agreement with the {Wright-Fisher} model.
The present work predicts that: (a) the time between clicks of the ratchet is insensitive to the value of the selection coefficient when the genomic mutation rate is large compared with the selection coefficient against a deleterious mutation, (b) the time interval between clicks of the ratchet has, approximately, an exponential distribution (or its discrete analogue). It is thus possible to determine the variance in times between clicks, given the expected time between clicks. Evidence for both (a) and (b) is seen in simulations.},

	abstract = {{{\textless}p{\textgreater}Previous} attempts to model the joint action of selection and mutation in finite populations have treated population size as being independent of the mutation load. However, the accumulation of deleterious mutations is expected to cause a gradual reduction in population size. Consequently, in small populations random genetic drift will progressively overpower selection making it easier to fix future mutations. This synergistic interaction, which we refer to as a mutational melt-down, ultimately leads to population extinction. For many conditions, the coefficient of variation of extinction time is less than 0.1, and for species that reproduce by binary fission, the expected extinction time is quite insensitive to population carrying capacity. These results are consistent with observations that many cultures of ciliated protozoans and vertebrate fibroblasts have characteristic extinction times. The model also predicts that clonal lineages are unlikely to survive more than 104 to 105 generations, which is consistent with existing data on parthenogenetic animals. Contrary to the usual view that Muller's ratchet does more damage when selection is weak, we show that the mean extinction time declines as mutations become more deleterious. Although very small sexual populations, such as self-fertilized lines, are subject to mutational meltdowns, recombination effectively eliminates the process when the effective population size exceeds a dozen or so. The concept of the effective mutation load is developed, and several procedures for estimating it are described. It is shown that this load can be reduced substantially when mutational effects are highly variable.},

Here N is population size, s is the selection coefficient and lambda is the deleterious mutation rate. For large parts of the parameter range, measuring time in units of size N, deleterious mutations accumulate according to a power law in N*lambda with exponent gamma if gamma{\textgreater}0.5. For gamma{\textless}0.5 mutations cannot accumulate. We obtain diffusion approximations for three different parameter regimes, depending on the speed of the ratchet.

A table is given showing the ratios thus found for different frequencies of advantageous mutations and different degrees of their advantage. It is shown that this calculation does not apply for mutant genes that act advantageously only when in some special combinations with one or more other mutant genes, and that as far as these cases of special synergism are concerned recombining lines have no evolutionary advantage over non-recombining ones. Other limitations of the formula are pointed out and assessed.
It is explained that most factors that retard the rate of recombination--for expample, linkage, rarity of outbreeding, intercalation of sexual reproduction between more frequent cycles of sexual propagation, and partial isolation between subpopulations--must usually cause little long-term retardation of the speed of advance that is fostered by recombination. Moreover, even where long-term evolutions has virtually ceased, recombination of mutant genes still confers upon a population the means of adopting short-term genetic "dodges", that adjust it to ecological and "physical" changes in its circumstances, much more rapidly than would be possible for a comparable asexual population.
Under conditions where only stability of type is needed, a non-recombining does not actually degenerate as a result of an excess of mutation over selection, after the usual equilibrium between these pressures is reached. However, a irreversible ratchet mechanism exists in the non-recombining species (unlike the recombining ones) that prevents selection, even if intensified, from reducing the mutational loads below the lightest that were in existence when the intensified selection started, whereas, contrariwise, "drift", and what might be called "selective noise" must allow occasional slips of the lightest loads in the direction of increased weight.},

For a population of size N, in which deleterious mutations occur at rate [lambda]/genome/ generation, and the relative fitness of an individual with k mutants is (1 - s)k, the most important parameter is n0 = Ne-[theta], where [theta] = [lambda]/s. If n0 is large ([greater-or-equal, slanted]25), deleterious mutations will accumulate very slowly, and independently of each other; if n0 is small ({\textless}1), the rate of accumulation of deleterious mutations will be greater than a natural population could plausibly bear; an estimate of the speed of the Ratchet for intermediate values of n0 is made. It is pointed out that the frequency distribution for the numbers of individuals carrying k mutants will retain its shape, but will move bodily to the right at the same average speed as the Ratchet. When favourable mutations also occur, the frequency distributions can move right of left; an estimate of the probability that any particular step is right or left is made, and it is shown that, for a given net rate of arrisal of deleterious mutations, the greater the rate of beneficial mutation, the greater the chance that beneficial mutations will accumulate.},

	title = {The Evolutionary Advantage Of Recombination},
	volume = {78},
	abstract = {The controversy over the evolutionary advantage of recombination initially discovered by Fisher and by Muller is reviewed. Those authors whose models had finite-population effects found an advantage of recombination, and those whose models had infinite populations found none. The advantage of recombination is that it breaks down random linkage disequilibrium generated by genetic drift. Hill and Robertson found that the average effect of this randomly-generated linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked loci to interfere with each other's response to selection, even where there was no gene interaction between the loci. This effect is shown to be identical to the original argument of Fisher and Muller. It also predicts the "ratchet mechanism" discovered by Muller, who pointed out that deleterious mutants would more readily increase in a population without recombination. Computer simulations of substitution of favorable mutants and of the long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential correctness of the original {Fisher-Muller} argument and the reality of the Muller ratchet mechanism. It is argued that these constitute an intrinsic advantage of recombination capable of accounting for its persistence in the face of selection for tighter linkage between interacting polymorphisms, and possibly capable of accounting for its origin.},

	abstract = {{{\textless}p{\textgreater}We} extend our earlier work on the role of deleterious mutations in the extinction of obligately asexual populations. First, we develop analytical models for mutation accumulation that obviate the need for time-consuming computer simulations in certain ranges of the parameter space. When the number of mutations entering the population each generation is fairly high, the number of mutations per individual and the mean time to extinction can be predicted using classical approaches in quantitative genetics. However, when the mutation rate is very low, a fixation-probability approach is quite effective. Second, we show that an intermediate selection coefficient (s) minimizes the time to extinction. The critical value of s can be quite low, and we discuss the evolutionary implications of this, showing that increased sensitivity to mutation and loss of capacity for {DNA} repair can be selectively advantageous in asexual organisms. Finally, we consider the consequences of the mutational meltdown for the extinction of mitochondrial lineages in sexual species.},
